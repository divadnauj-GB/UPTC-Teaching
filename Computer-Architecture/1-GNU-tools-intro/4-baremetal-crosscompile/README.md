# Baremetal/Freestanding Programming

This directory contains two examples to illustrate the baremetal programming on ARM processors using as example the raspberry pi 2 and raspberry pi 4. 

These examples were adapted according the guidelines introduced in this [link](https://wiki.osdev.org/Raspberry_Pi_Bare_Bones). For more examples about baremetal onf Raspberry pi board can be found [here](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial.git).
