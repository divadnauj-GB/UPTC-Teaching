# Digital design resources

This directory contains examples and material for developing, simulating and implementing digital designs using VDHL or Verilog. 

- [FPGAS](./FPGAS/): incorporates basic introduction to use ALTERA devices, Quartus instalation, etc.
- [Simulation-tools](./Simulation-tools/): This directory contains basic examples using different simulation tools for VHDL and Verilog.
- [Examples](./Examples/): Contains some intro examples usign VHDL and verilog, most of the examples are simulated using GHDL for VHD and Verilator for Verilog.
